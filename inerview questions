1.SQL---> SQL stands for the Structured Query Language.
       -> SQL was initially invented in 1970
       -> It is a database language used for database creation, deletion, fetching and modifying rows, etc.
       -> sometimes, it is pronounced as 'sequel.'


 2. What are the usages of SQL?

        To execute queries against a database
        To retrieve data from a database
        To inserts records in a database
        To updates records in a database
        To delete records from a database
        To create new databases
        To create new tables in a database
        To create views in a database
        To perform complex operations on the database.

3. Does SQL support programming language features?

        It is a common language that doesn't have a loop, conditional statements, and logical operations. \
        It cannot be used for anything other than data manipulation. 
        It is a command language to perform database operations. 
        The purpose of SQL is to retrieve, manipulate, update, delete, and perform complex operations like joins on the data present in the database.

 4.What are the subsets of SQL?

      Data definition language (DDL): It defines the data structure that consists of commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE etc.

      Data manipulation language (DML): It is used to manipulate existing data in the database. The commands in this category are SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc.

      Data control language (DCL): It controls access to the data stored in the database. The commands in this category include GRANT and REVOKE.

      Transaction Control Language (TCL): It is used to deal with the transaction operations in the database. The commands in this category are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SET TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT, etc.


 5.What is the purpose of DDL Language?

      DDL stands for Data definition language 
      Defines structure of the database when the database is created
      we can use the DDL commands to add, remove, or modify tables.
      commands:CREATE, ALTER , TRUNCATE and DELETE 

6.What is the purpose of DML Language?

    Data manipulation language makes the user able to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database.    
    The DML commands can only perform read-only operations on data. 

    We can perform the following operations using DDL language:

        Insert data into the database through the INSERT command.
        Update data in the database through the UPDATE command.
        Delete data from the database through the DELETE command.


7. What is the purpose of DCL Language?

    Data control language allows users to control access and permission management to the database. 
    It is the subset of a database, which decides that what part of the database should be accessed by which user at what point of time. 
    It includes two commands, GRANT and REVOKE.

GRANT: It enables system administrators to assign privileges and roles to the specific user accounts to perform specific tasks on the database.
REVOKE: It enables system administrators to revoke privileges and roles from the user accounts so that they cannot use the previously assigned permission on the database.


8.What is a primary key?

      A primary key is a field that uniquely identify each record in the table
      It is one of a special kind of unique key.
      If the column contains a primary key
          --no null values
          --no duplicates
          --only one pk
          --we cant apply pk on nullable cols

 9.	What is a foreign key?

      The foreign key is used to link one or more tables together. 
      It is also known as the referencing key

  10.What is a unique key?

   column will be unique. It means a column cannot stores duplicate values. 
         --only one null value
         --no duplicates
         --table allows multiple unique keys
         --it can apply on nullable col

  11.difference between a primary key and a unique key?

         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       |   --no duplicates                          |   --no duplicates                          |
       |  --only one pk                             |   --table allows multiple unique keys      |

 12.What is RDBMS?

      RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
      It is a database management system based on a relational model.
      RDBMS stores the data into the collection of tables

13.What is Normalization in a Database?

      Normalization is used to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database.

      There are some rules of database normalization, 

                First normal form(1NF)
                Second normal form(2NF)
                Third normal form(3NF)
                Boyce-Codd normal form(BCNF)

     Using these steps, the redundancy, anomalies, inconsistency of the data in the database can be removed.


FIRAT NORMAL FORM(1NF) :

  if a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first normal form 
  A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.

ex:  --------------------------------------------------                             --------------------------------------------------

SECOND NORMAL FORM(2NF)

        A relation must be in first normal form 
        Relation must not contain any partial dependency.

        It shud be in in second normal form.

      14. index:
               An index is a schema object
                It is used by the server to speed up the retrieval of rows
                
                An index helps to speed up select queries and where clauses
                but it slows down data input, with the update and the insert statements.
                
                Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data
              
              
        Syntax:

               CREATE INDEX index
               ON TABLE column;

       For multiple columns:
       Syntax:

               CREATE INDEX index
               ON TABLE (column1, column2,.....);

 15. Define a Relation Schema
`      
           Relation Schema is specified as a set of attributes. It is also known as table schema.


16.  three levels of data abstraction:

       Physical level : It is the lowest level of abstraction. 
                        It describes how data are stored.

       Logical level  : It is the next higher level of abstraction. 
                        It describes what data are stored in the database and what the relationship among those data is.

       View level     : It is the highest level of data abstraction. 
                        It describes only part of the entire database.
                        
  17.There are two integrity rules in DBMS:

              Entity Integrity       : It specifies that "Primary key cannot have a NULL value."

              Referential Integrity : It specifies that "Foreign Key can be either a NULL value or should be the Primary Key value of other relation

                 |
                 |------->C===CONSISTENCES    ------>the database must be consistent before and after transaction
18. ACID-------->|
                 |------->I===ISOLATION       ------>multiple transactions occur independently without interference
                 |  
                 |------->D===DURABILITY      ------->This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored and they persist even if a system failure occurs
